While [The Powder Toy](https://github.com/The-Powder-Toy/The-Powder-Toy) might seem like a purely grid-based game, particles actually move in steps smaller than 1 pixel!

This script allows you to see exactly where they are. Witness one of this game's inner workings and harness it to your liking!

If you do not already have the script manager, press `~` on your keyboard to open the console, write the command `tpt.installScriptManager()`, and press enter.

Press the "Lua" button to open the script manager, then select "Online" and then "Filter". Type in "SubpixelScope" and then hit "Okay". The script will appear in the list to the left. Finally, hit "Download" and you're ready to go!

2. Adds a line pointing where the particle is moving.
3. Adds a green dot that shows (roughly) where the particle will be next frame.
4. Only shows the velocity line and next position when hovering over a particle.
5. Shows nothing unless you're hovering over a particle.
